# OpenStacks-for-Change: Modular, open-source tools and documentation stacks for public interest research, evaluation, and program design.

*An open, modular ecosystem of tools and infrastructures for better research, evaluation, and program design — built in India, shared for impact.*

---

## ✨ Why this exists

Across public health, climate programs, education systems, and gender equity work — we keep solving the same problems and rebuilding the same tools from scratch.

**Open Stacks for Change** is my response:  
A growing ecosystem of field-aware, testable, and reusable stacks designed for public interest work — built from real-world experience in MEL systems, research, and programs.

These stacks help answer a deeper question:
> 🧩 *How do we build systems that learn — not just deliver?*

## 🌱 Current Stacks

| Stack | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [**InsightStack**](https://github.com/Varnasr/InsightStack) | Knowledge systems, documentation SOPs, and planning calculators |
| [**FieldStack**](https://github.com/Varnasr/FieldStack) | Applied R tools and MEL workflows — real notebooks, real data |
| [**EquityStack**](https://github.com/Varnasr/EquityStack) | Python-powered templates for WEE, education, health, and evaluation analysis |

Each stack is real, runnable, and used in the field — not a prototype.

## 🔭 What’s Next

Upcoming stacks include:

- **PolicyStack** → Scheme analysis, policy mapping, and budget planning tools  
- **ClimateStack** → Composite risk scores, resilience modeling, and geo-mapping  
- **EduStack** → Learning assessment pipelines, education dashboard prep  
- **SocialStack** → Tools for rapid ethnography, qualitative coding, and NLP  
- **InfraStack** → Access scoring, infrastructure mapping, spatial planning  

Each new stack will be:
- Open-source, reproducible, and field-ready  
- Documented and tested  
- Designed for public impact

Built in India. Open for the world.  
If our systems are meant to serve people, then our tools should too. ✨
